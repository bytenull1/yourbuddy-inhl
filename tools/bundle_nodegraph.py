"""Regenerate the nav graph shipped inside the DLL.

    python tools/bundle_nodegraph.py [--version N] [--source <nodegraph.json>]
    python tools/bundle_nodegraph.py --check [--base REF]

Reads your live graph (default: BepInEx/config/YourBuddyRoutes/nodegraph.json, found
by walking up from this repository) and writes YourBuddy/Resources/nodegraph.bundled.json
with a BundleVersion stamp. The plugin rewrites a user's cached copy whenever that
number changes, which is what makes an updated graph land without touching anyone's
own nodes - see docs/navigation.md.

Bump the version every time you change the graph, or nobody will get the update.

--check writes nothing: it validates the committed bundle and exits 1 on a problem. With
--base REF it also requires a bigger BundleVersion than REF's whenever the file changed.
