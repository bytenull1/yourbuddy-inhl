# Navigation - node graph, A\*, path following

Files: `BuddyNodeGraph.cs` (graph and search), `BuddyBehaviour.Navigation.cs` (following),
`BuddyBehaviour.Obstacles.cs` (steering and recovery). Rules live in [invariants.md](invariants.md).

---

## 1. The model

The game has no navmesh. Routing runs over a graph of **hand-placed** nodes (F8 editor, see
[reference.md](reference.md)).

Every node has an `Owner`:

| Owner | Stored in | Active when |
|---|---|---|
| `"ship"` | player-ship-local space, plus the room it stands on | that room is built ([below](#ship-nodes-follow-the-ships-upgrades)) |
| station name (e.g. `ShipyardStation`) | that station's local space | the ship is docked to it |
| `"world"` | `WorldObjects` space | always |

Owner-local storage survives flight, docking and saves: the game moves the world around the ship
([never-cache-node-world-positions](invariants.md#never-cache-node-world-positions)).

Nodes are `Ground` or `Stair`. `Stair` raises the auto-edge climb cap and is the one exception to
[entry-seeds-on-own-deck](invariants.md#entry-seeds-on-own-deck).

### Ship nodes follow the ship's upgrades

The ship's rooms depend on its upgrade stage
([game-model.md](game-model.md#the-players-ship-is-rebuilt-by-its-upgrade-stage)). A ship node
remembers its room and is walkable only while that room is built
([a-ship-node-rides-its-room](invariants.md#a-ship-node-rides-its-room)). In the editor such a node
is grey and unselectable, and the readout names the room (`[ship/Core_M01]`).

The shipped graph is drawn at stage 5, plus one link for stages 0–2: cockpit `#288` → airlock
`#304`. A link you draw holds in every stage where its two rooms stand as they do now, so fix a gap
at one stage by drawing the link *at* that stage - it cannot break the others.

### Links

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Force** | an edge regardless of line of sight or height |
| **Block** | suppresses an auto edge |
| **Priority** | Force, plus: arriving at A from anywhere except B, the next hop must be B. Arriving via B leaves all exits open |

`AutoLink = false` means manual links only. The shipped graph is entirely manual.

### Where the nodes come from

| File | Written by | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| `nodegraph.bundled.json` | the plugin, from a resource in the DLL | rewritten when the DLL's `BundleVersion` changes |
| `nodegraph.json` | F6, `buddy_node save`, 20 s autosave | never touched by an update |

**Per owner:** your nodes replace the bundled ones for that ship or station; owners you never
touched come from the bundle. Editing a bundled owner *forks* it - the whole owner is copied into
your file and stops following updates. `buddy_node bundled` shows the split; `buddy_node unfork
<owner>` hands one back. Forked owners are listed explicitly, so "I want no nodes here" differs
from "I never touched this". Anything finer than per-owner would make updates unpredictable.

Your nodes are numbered from `UserIdBase` (100000) so bundle ids never collide. Regenerate the
bundle with [`tools/bundle_nodegraph.py`](../tools/bundle_nodegraph.py). It takes your forked
owners and keeps every other owner, with its links, from the current bundle: your file holds only
what you forked, and copying it alone once shipped a bundle with no ship graph. To drop an owner,
fork it and empty it.

> **Block and Priority only act while A\* traverses edges.** If links seem ignored, check the route
> chains at `debug_level 2`. A one-hop route (`via #99 -> goal`) never used an edge - that is a
> seeding problem ([entry-seeds-on-own-deck](invariants.md#entry-seeds-on-own-deck)).

---

## 2. Nodes are not on the floor

Nodes sit wherever the editor dropped them. In the shipped `ShipyardStation` graph:

| node | node Y | floor under it | hover |
|---|---|---|---|
| #95–#100 (lower walkway) | 1.00 | 0.00 | +1.00 |
| #101 (mid-ramp, `Stair`) | 1.27 | ~0.30 | ~+1.0 |
| #102–#104 (upper ledge) | 1.62 | 0.63 | ~+1.0 |

`AddNode` floor-snaps new nodes, so a graph can mix floor-level and hovering markers. The fix is to
probe each node's floor, not rewrite stored positions (which would move the user's markers).
Rule: [floor-to-floor](invariants.md#floor-to-floor).

---

## 3. Edge cache

`RebuildEdges` builds `_edges` (node id → outgoing edges) and `_priorityExits`. It rebuilds when the
graph is dirty, the dock or ship layout changes, or `MaxEdgeDist` changes, and clears the node
hover cache.

Auto edges need: both nodes `AutoLink`, no `Block` link, an allowed climb (`AutoEdgeAllowed`, deck to
deck) and `NavProbe.ThinLos`. Force and Priority skip all of it
([force-and-priority-have-no-los](invariants.md#force-and-priority-have-no-los)).

Edges use **thin** line of sight, not a body sweep. A body sweep rejected the links users drew; low
furniture is left to whisker steering.

---

## 4. A\* (`FindPath`)

```
FindPath(start, end, cameFromPos?, avoidEntry?)
    start = FloorUnderBuddy()     a floor point - its Y is the start floor
    end   = player / target       a body point or node, so its floor is probed
```

`start.y` is never re-probed ([the-start-point-is-already-a-floor](invariants.md#the-start-point-is-already-a-floor)).

The returned `NavPath` stores, per waypoint, whether the arriving edge is forced and the deck under
it (`WaypointFloorY`). Following code reads decks from there instead of re-probing - that is how it
finds [stair legs](#6a-stair-legs).

**Seeding tests every candidate.** Every active node within `MaxSeedDist` goes through
`CanReachEntry`; all that pass are start nodes. Testing only the nearest few trapped the buddy when
its surroundings were blocked. `CanReachEntry` ([one-entry-predicate](invariants.md#one-entry-predicate))
admits a node when either:

- it is within `SeedCloseDist` flat and on the same deck (arm's length, no line of sight needed); or
- the deck test passes ([entry-seeds-on-own-deck](invariants.md#entry-seeds-on-own-deck)) and
  `ThinLos` is clear.

**Entry cost includes height.** A seed starts at `GoalCost(start, node)`, so the buddy walks to the
*foot* of the stairs rather than scrabbling at a mid-tread.

> A flight longer than `StairSeedRadius` (2.5 m) has no seedable foot from partway along it. The
> commitment rule handles it
> ([a-stair-entry-is-committed-once-taken](invariants.md#a-stair-entry-is-committed-once-taken)),
> but a node placed mid-flight fixes it at the source.

**No seeds** → the single nearest active node by `GoalCost`, with the backtrack penalty
([fallback-respects-backtrack](invariants.md#fallback-respects-backtrack)).

**The search does not stop at the first node that sees the goal.** Each expanded node records its
total (route + validated finish); the best wins. It stops when the open set's minimum `f` can no
longer beat the best total.

**Two ways to end a route:**

| | Condition | Goal appended? |
|---|---|---|
| **Finish** | goal within `MaxGoalFinishDist`, same deck, `ThinLos` and knee-height `WalkLos` clear ([an-endpoint-must-be-walkable-not-merely-visible](invariants.md#an-endpoint-must-be-walkable-not-merely-visible)) | yes |
| **Approach** | no clear finish; the expanded node with the lowest `GoalCost`, if it beats standing still by `ApproachMinGain` | **no** |

Appending the goal after an approach would recreate the beeline
([seed-radius-is-not-finish-length](invariants.md#seed-radius-is-not-finish-length)). If nothing
beats standing still, `FindPath` returns null and Follow walks directly.

**A clear, short goal skips the graph** ([a-clear-short-goal-beats-the-graph](invariants.md#a-clear-short-goal-beats-the-graph)).

**A failed search does not keep an old plan** unless its waypoint is within one flight
([a-stale-plan-is-worse-than-none](invariants.md#a-stale-plan-is-worse-than-none)).

**Doors the buddy cannot open are rejected everywhere**, Force and Priority edges included
([locked-doors-block-edges](invariants.md#locked-doors-block-edges)). The test comes in through the
`SegmentBlockedByDoor` hook, and `LastPathBlockedByDoor` tells callers why a search failed
([doors.md §3](doors.md#3-routing-around-what-it-cannot-open)).

`GoalCost(a, b)` = flat distance + `|Δfloor| × VerticalCostFactor` (4), so a node a deck below the
target is never "close".

---

## 5. Path commitment

`UpdateFollow` replans at most every `NavPathRecalcInterval` (0.22 s). A plan survives while:

1. it is not exhausted;
2. on a stair leg, the buddy is still between the leg's decks
   ([off-the-flight-is-off-the-plan](invariants.md#off-the-flight-is-off-the-plan));
3. the goal has not moved more than `NavPathGoalDrift`;
4. the entry stretch is OK - forced, an off-level [stair entry](invariants.md#a-stair-entry-is-committed-once-taken),
   the buddy is [still on the route](invariants.md#commitment-skips-on-route), or `CanReachEntry` passes.

There is deliberately **no** "next stretch blocked" check
([force-and-priority-have-no-los](invariants.md#force-and-priority-have-no-los)).

### Recovery ladder

| Trigger | Response |
|---|---|
| feet leave the current stair leg's decks | replan at once (no index, no backtrack penalty); Wander drops the plan and steps off toward the leg's head |
| entry blocked `EntryBlockedAvoidAfter` times in `EntryBlockedWindow` | replan avoiding that waypoint; if nothing routes, retry without ([a-barred-waypoint-is-a-preference-not-a-wall](invariants.md#a-barred-waypoint-is-a-preference-not-a-wall)) |
| entry blocked `EntryBlockedStepOffAfter` times | drop the plan, step off, replan |
| moving but not getting closer | `UpdateGoalProgress` bars the waypoint for `UnreachableWaypointHold` |
| no progress for 3 cycles under a low ceiling | `EmergencyUnstick` ([a-low-ceiling-is-measured-from-the-body](invariants.md#a-low-ceiling-is-measured-from-the-body)) |
| no route because of a door it cannot open | stand still and log it ([stand-still-when-door-blocked](invariants.md#stand-still-when-door-blocked)) |
| no movement at all, above its own floor plane | step off ([idle-above-the-floor-plane-is-a-stall](invariants.md#idle-above-the-floor-plane-is-a-stall)) |

All rows but the last need `wantMove`. The last catches a buddy perched on furniture that produces
no movement at all.

---

## 5a. Wander pacing

Picking a destination and planning to it happen in one call (`TryStartWanderRoute`), trying up to
`WanderPickAttempts` nodes. Idle time is `WanderIdleMin`–`WanderIdleMax` after arriving and
`WanderRetryDelay` after a failure. Three failed rounds trigger the shared step-off
([step-off-applies-in-every-mode](invariants.md#step-off-applies-in-every-mode)).

Counting: [escalate-over-a-window](invariants.md#escalate-over-a-window). Index:
[drop-the-index-on-a-blocked-entry](invariants.md#drop-the-index-on-a-blocked-entry).

---

## 6. Waypoint advance

Shared by Follow and Wander: [waypoint-advance-is-dual](invariants.md#waypoint-advance-is-dual).
Reaching a waypoint is not enough to leave it if its outgoing leg is a flight the buddy is off.

Passing a real node records it as `lastDepartedWaypoint`
([backtrack-memory-outlives-the-plan](invariants.md#backtrack-memory-outlives-the-plan)). A replan
that continues the old route keeps progress, mapped onto the new plan
([drop-the-index-on-a-blocked-entry](invariants.md#drop-the-index-on-a-blocked-entry)).

---

## 6a. Stair legs

A leg whose ends are on different decks is a flight of stairs
([a-stair-leg-is-walked-not-improvised](invariants.md#a-stair-leg-is-walked-not-improvised)):

| On a stair leg | Why |
|---|---|
| steer `StairLegLookahead` along the leg, not at its end | turning onto a flight doesn't clip the railing end |
| no whisker detours, stuck sidestep or auto-jump | whiskers see the flight overhead as a wall; a sidestep runs along the landing; a railing looks like furniture |
| a waypoint whose outgoing leg the buddy is on counts as reached | a mid-flight replan doesn't send it back up |
| a waypoint whose outgoing leg the buddy is *off* is never left | the 3D advance can't hand over an unwalkable leg |
| leaving the leg's decks ends the plan | [off-the-flight-is-off-the-plan](invariants.md#off-the-flight-is-off-the-plan) |

Which legs exist is still decided by the user's links.

---

## 7. Reading a `FindPath` capture

At `debug_level 2`:

```
[ai] Replanning (entry stretch blocked): buddy (-8.7, 1.2, 29.2) -> goal (-5.4, 0.6, 26.9),
     start (-8.7, 0.6, 29.2), cameFrom=(-8.7, 0.6, 28.6), blocked x2 in 4s
[nav] FindPath: 72 candidates in range, 2 visible entry seeds: #102(1,4m, +1,0y) #98(4,3m, +0,4y)
[nav] FindPath: total 9,5m via #98 -> goal, cameFrom=(-9.0, 1.6, 30.5)
```

- **`buddy` vs `start`** - body vs floor under it; ~0.6 m apart.
- **`0 visible entry seeds`** on flat ground is a red flag: the deck test rejects everything.
- **`+N,Ny`** per seed - deck difference, floor to floor. ~0 on the buddy's own level.
- **the chain** - `#98 -> #99 -> #101(stair) -> goal` is healthy. A one-hop `via #98 -> goal`
  means no edge was used.
- **`cameFrom=none`** mid-burst means the backtrack memory was lost.
- **identical repeated lines with a frozen `buddy`** - a commitment livelock
  ([one-entry-predicate](invariants.md#one-entry-predicate)).

Stair legs add:

```
[ai] Walking the stair leg (-2.6, 2.3, 26.8) -> (-2.5, 1.0, 23.6) (decks 1,25 -> -0,05)     level 2, once per leg
[ai] Left the stair leg to (-2.5, 1.0, 23.6): feet 1,98 (probe floor 1,98) are outside -0,55..1,75 - replanning from here   level 1
  ... jumpArmed=False grounded=True stairLeg=True                                            level 3 obstacle report
```

`Left the stair leg` is a recovery. More than one per flight means something keeps pushing the
buddy off; the obstacle reports around it say what.

## 8. The OxygenStation stairwell

The hardest level change in the game and the reference test for the stair rules.

`OxygenStation` local coordinates (world z = local z + 20.62). Markers hover ~1.0 m above their deck.
Every link is Force; every node has `AutoLink = false`.

| Node | local (x, y, z) | deck | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| #399 | (−2.46, 1.00, 2.93) | 0.00 | bottom |
| #400 / #401 | (−2.60, 2.25, 6.15) / (−1.19, 2.25, 6.31) | 1.25 | landing pair |
| #402 / #403 | (−1.19, 3.50, 3.98) / (−2.57, 3.50, 3.70) | 2.50 | landing pair |
| #404 / #405 | (−2.53, 4.75, 6.26) / (−1.07, 4.75, 6.36) | 3.75 | landing pair |
| #406 / #408 | (−1.02, 6.00, 3.90) / (−2.63, 6.00, 3.71) | 5.00 | landing pair |
| #409 / #410 | (−2.53, 7.25, 6.23) / (0.97, 7.25, 6.25) | 6.25 | top |

Chain `399 → 400 → 401 → … → 408 → 409 → 410`. The bottom flight is 3.22 m long for 1.25 m of rise
(21°); the others 2.3–2.6 m (26–28°). `buddy_goto` indices: #399 is 149, #410 is 159.

Rules that came out of this stairwell:
[walkable-ground-is-not-an-obstacle](invariants.md#walkable-ground-is-not-an-obstacle),
[a-stair-entry-is-committed-once-taken](invariants.md#a-stair-entry-is-committed-once-taken),

[drop-the-index-on-a-blocked-entry](invariants.md#drop-the-index-on-a-blocked-entry).

Lesson: once the plan was right, the remaining faults were the steering layer applying flat-ground
logic on stairs. Moving nodes was never needed.
